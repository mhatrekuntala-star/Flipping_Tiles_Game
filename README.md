# Flipping_Tiles_Game
Developed a logic-based puzzle game where the player flips tiles on a grid to make all tiles the same color. Clicking a tile changes its color and also changes the color of its adjacent tiles (up, down, left, right). The goal is to flip tiles strategically until the entire grid shows a uniform color. Python, Tkinter, OOPS technologies are used.
